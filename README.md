# BSEncryption

Award-winning project submission for UofTHacks VIII

## About
Bank Statement Encryption (BSE) is a method of securing a user's bank statements while still being able to keep them locally on their machine at all times, without needing internet access. It allows the user to still feel like they have ownership over their bank statements while at the same time reducing the risk of their private information and account details being compromised. This repository is a demo banking application that utilizes the encryption system.
